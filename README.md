## Getting Started 
If you want to work through this project to learn more about Unity, Augmented Reality, and game development in general, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/aornelas/AR101.git`
1. Go into the root of the project: `$ cd AR101`
1. Checkout the first commit: `$ git checkout 60ab1ab`
1. Create a new branch for you to work on: `git checkout -b my-branch`
1. Try replicating [each commit](https://github.com/aornelas/AR101/commits/master)!


## More Context
This repository was originally written as a guided course, so the commit descriptions are not currently detailed enough. But take it as a learning opportunity! Read the commit message, browse the diff, and attempt to do your own research to accomplish the same result.

If you get really stuck, you can always cherry pick the next commit from master (.e.g, for the second commit: `$ git cherry-pick eaf0fe8`) to complete that step. Also, feel free to open issues or ask questions in the commits themselves (via the GitHub front end) and I'll get to them when I get a chance!

*Have fun!*
